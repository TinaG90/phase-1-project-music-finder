# The Silent Jukebox

## Overview

This is a single page application that allows a user to search for music by genre. The app will then display cards of the specified genre which includes information about the albums.

## Installation

To install and operate this application user will need to clone this repo and make sure json server is running by typing json-server --watch db.json in your terminal. All data in this project's JSON is unique to this project, and it does not pull data from an API

```
$ json-server --watch db.json
```

## Basic use

After the user loads the page, they can then begin typing a specific music genre into the search bar at the top of the page. The card will automatically populate. The user can then hover over images to see lyrics from popular songs off that album or click on the heart, located inside the card, to like the album. They can type in a new genre to see other albums in another genre.
